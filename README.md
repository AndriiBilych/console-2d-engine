Description
---------

This is a learning project in C++. I am exploring some ideas I've come up with while learning C++.
Currently features a very basic framework for drawing 2d graphics using ASCII characters, menu, 
keyboard input handling and benchmarking class. 

I am currently working on a few games and ideas to add to this project.
