Console Visualiser
=====

Description
---------
This is a learning project in C++. I am exploring some ideas I've come up with while learning C++.
Currently features a very basic framework for drawing 2d graphics using ASCII characters

I am currently working on a few games and ideas to add to this project.

Using the engine
---------
Engine is greatly simplified version of olcConsoleGameEngine by javidx9 and to use it a project class must inherit from the 
engine class.

Compiling & Running
---------
The project was built with MSVC and Visual Studio 2019

Graphs
---------
First project features 8 trigonometric functions and a pointers moving on the graphs.
